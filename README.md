The following project include following
1. I've used pre-trained model of CNN "googlenet"
2. ImageNet dataset has been used 
3. Using dnn module of OpenCv, I've imported googlenet .caffemodel and prototxt which is the configuration of architeture

After execution of following code, You'll come to know that how pre-trained model of CNN being used in classification using imageNet dataset

I've used synset_word.txt for imagenet database, which include their wordnet ID's which has been defined in model all images have an
